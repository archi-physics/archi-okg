"""CMSSW release catalog source — cache-backed, with releases.map option.

Merge of two lineages (req.w2.sources-catalogs):

- okg-deployments ``cms/cms_sources/cmssw.py`` (324 LOC,
  ``CMSSWReleaseSource``) at ``main@f33a9c4`` — canonical. Reads a JSON
  records cache and emits ``cmssw_release`` nodes (individual releases
  + ``CMSSW_X_Y_X`` family nodes) plus deterministic ``supersedes``
  edges between known predecessor releases.
- The archi W1 seam-proof module this file previously held — the
  public cms-bot ``releases.map`` fetch (no auth). Kept as an *option*:
  pass ``releases_map_url``/``map_cache_path`` (and ``fetch=True``) to
  build the same record set from the fetched map instead of the JSON
  cache. Emission is the cms path's in both modes (families +
  supersedes edges), so the W1 mode now also emits supersedes edges.

Changes from the cms original: cache/probe helpers come from
:mod:`archi.auth.cache` with an explicit ``base`` parameter; the
hardcoded ``data/cms/cmssw-releases/records.json`` path is a parameter
(default keeps the cms layout minus the ``cms/`` segment).

Registry-entry template — same three prerequisites as
``archi/sources/jira.py``'s template (compose
``archi/schemas/operations.yaml`` + ``archi/schemas/bridges/operations.yaml``
into the deployment; ``output_scope_summary`` must accompany
``output_signature``; standard ``sync:`` block). ::

#
#   `_<suffix>`  -- the usual form (`_patch2`, `_pre3`, `_ROOT6...`). The
#                   trailing `.*` alternative accepts any separated suffix.
#                   That is pre-existing latitude, left as it is here;
#   `<suffix>`   -- no separator, which cms-bot writes for a few real old
#                   builds: `CMSSW_1_4_3g483`, a Geant4 8.3 variant carried
#                   on two architectures beside `CMSSW_1_4_3`. Restricted to
#                   lowercase letters followed by digits, because without a
#                   separator there is nothing to tell a build suffix from a
#                   typo glued to a valid triple -- `CMSSW_14_0_1TYPO` would

            # upstream we want to be told about, so it degrades the scope
            # until someone looks and adds it here deliberately.

            # label, an unknown product -- counts as a skip and degrades the

            # does parse as a release can never be discarded as a family.
